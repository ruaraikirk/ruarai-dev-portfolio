CoDO was a small project for a friend of mine based in Melbourne, Australia. At the time was was working on a project in SAP utilising GatsbyJS, and it seemed to be a neat way to produce fast sites, which were very customisable, and also provided non technical users an easy was to update their content.

It is hosted using Netlify, which deploys straing from the Github repo and updates as changes are pushed to the master branch. The Netlify CMS also allows the user to update their blog. For more, see <https://www.codo.net.au/>.
