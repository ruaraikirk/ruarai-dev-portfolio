  aangine is a project management web application developed using  contemporary
  design patterns and JavaScript technologies like React and Redux in the
  front-end. The backend implementation employs microservices technologies using
  Docker, Java, Spring Boot IO and MongoDB. However, unlike conventional project
  management software offerings, aangine is developed specifically for the
  management of project portfolios, also known as Project Portfolio Management
  (PPM).

As part of the team at [Continuous Software Ltd](https://www.continuoussoftware.ie/). I am primarily involved in development of of their flagship product, aangine. In terms of front end structure, aangine is developed on top of a React + Redux architecture and utilises a range of additional technologies and libraries in order to provide a a rich and efficient user experience. These include, but are not limited to:

* Jest for testing
* Ant Design for UI design
* ESLint for lintingAg-Grid for tables and grids
* Axios as a promise-based HTTP client
* LinguiJS for internationalisation
* and many more...

As part of this project, because of the nature of working with a small team, I have also been involved in projects and tasks relating to DevOps (for example a Jenkins pipeline for the implementation of automatic semantic versioning to track releases, in line with <https://semver.org/>) and back end (for example working on one of the microservices based on Node which is responsible for exporting of reports to MS Excel).

Unlike conventional project management software offerings, aangine is developed specifically for the management of project portfolios, also known as Project Portfolio Management (PPM) in a reliable, secure and scalable manner. Traditional project management software suffers from high complexity, uncertainty and nonlinearity that arises in time and cost management when multiple projects are managed at the same time. This product is sought to be an industry first and aims to resolve the master classic planning issues within the traditional bottom-up and manual project planning processes.
