This project relates to the development of a  dynamic web application named ‘MotorcycleNewb’. Prior to this project, I had gone through the process of gaining their motorcycle licence in Ireland, during which it was noted that much of the relevant and important information required was spread across numerous forums and websites, and oftentimes conflicting in nature.

The goal of this project is to develop a dynamic web application comprised of various software technologies, components and tiers (i.e. backend database, application, and client front-end interface). This project was also an opportunity to apply software development methodologies with a view to manage the project management from conception to delivery.

The motorcycle industry can seem confusing and intimidating to new riders. From getting your first provisional licence, to finding a training school and buying your first motorbike, there was no unified location where an individual could acquire the initial information to get started, discuss issues with fellow enthusiasts, as well as share their experience. This presented an opportunity to develop a unique offering whilst also demonstrating some of the core computer science concepts studied throughout my studies in Technological University Dublin (TUD).
